# Data engineering - AI22

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DON'T USE THIS REPO YET

The aim of this course is to learn various data engineering concepts both theoretically and through implementations using various technologies. Data engineering is a very important topic where the focus is on ingesting data into a data pipeline and transforming it in different ways to serve and enable downstream works. Ideally roles such as data scientists, data analysts and business intelligence should not worry about where to find data and how to transform it, but instead work in their respective specialist domains.

This course builds upon previous skills in:

- pandas, numpy
- data visualisation tools: matplotlib, seaborn and plotly
- git and github

This course repo contains all lecture codes, lecture slides and exercises.

## Schedule

The schedule is divided into two parts: pre-summer and post-summer, where the first part focuses heavily on theory and core knowledge and the second part you will use what you've learnt to apply in a realistic project.
